# Deploy a Django Rest Api on AWS EC2 using Docker, NGINX, Gunicorn and GitHubÂ Action.

Django, a high-level Python web framework, is a popular choice for building RESTful APIs. Once your Django Rest API has been developed and tested, deploying it becomes a crucial step in making it accessible to users. In this blog post, we'll guide you through the process of deploying a Django Rest API on AWS EC2 using Docker for containerization, NGINX as a reverse proxy and GitHub Actions for automated deployment.

In this blog, we'll take a closer look at each step, explain the concepts, provide code snippets and show you exactly what you need to do. Let's get to the heart of the matter!

Let's get started on our journey !!
